             <p> When your legs don't work like they used to before And I can't sweep you off of your feet Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks And darling, I will be loving you till we're seventy And baby, my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three And I'm thinking 'bout how People fall in love in mysterious ways Maybe just the touch of a hand Well me, I fall in love with you every single day I just wanna tell you I am </p>

            <p>The sunset faded to twilight before anything further happened.  The crowd far away on the left, towards Woking, seemed to grow, and I heard now a faint murmur from it.  The little knot of people towards Chobham dispersed.  There was scarcely an intimation of movement from the pit.</p>

        <p>It was this, as much as anything, that gave people courage, and I suppose the new arrivals from Woking also helped to restore confidence.  At any rate, as the dusk came on a slow, intermittent movement upon the sand pits began, a movement that seemed to gather force as the stillness of the evening about the cylinder remained unbroken.  Vertical black figures in twos and threes would advance, stop, watch, and advance again, spreading out as they did so in a thin irregular crescent that promised to enclose the pit in its attenuated horns.  I, too, on my side began to move towards the pit.</p>

            <p>Then I saw some cabmen and others had walked boldly into the sand pits, and heard the clatter of hoofs and the gride of wheels.  I saw a lad trundling off the barrow of apples.  And then, within thirty yards of the pit, advancing from the direction of Horsell, I noted a little black knot of men, the foremost of whom was waving a white flag.</p>

Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base.</p>

                <p>Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed. <span class="citation">"Don't under&shy;estimate the Force. I suggest you try it again, Luke."</span> This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. In my experience, there is no such thing as luck. You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home!</p>
                <p>You don't believe in the Force, do you? Partially, but it also obeys your commands. The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. As you wish.</p>

            <span class="headline hl3">The buzz of the little world </span><p><span class="headline hl4">A thousand unknown plants</span></p></div><p>I should be incapable of drawing a single stroke at the present moment; and yet I feel that I never was a greater artist than now. When, while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me, and the meridian sun strikes the upper surface of the impenetrable foliage of my trees, and but a few stray gleams steal into the inner sanctuary, I throw myself down among the tall grass by the trickling stream; and, as I lie close to the earth, a thousand unknown plants are noticed by me: when I hear the buzz of the little world among the stalks, and grow familiar with the countless indescribable forms of the insects and flies, then I feel the presence of the Almighty, who formed us in his own image, and the breath</p>

            <p>Sometimes I feel like all I ever do is
                Find different ways to word the same old song
                Ever since I came along
                From the day the song called “Hi! My Name Is” dropped
                Started thinking my name was Fault
                ‘Cause any time things went wrong
                I was the one who they would blame it on
                The media made me the equivalent
                Of a modern-day Genghis Khan
                Tried to argue it was only entertainment, dog
                Gangster? Nah, courageous balls
                Had to change my style, they said I'm way too soft
                And I sound like AZ and Nas, out came the claws
                And the fangs been out since then
                But up until the instant that I went against it
                It was ingrained in me
                That I wouldn't amount to a shit stain, I thought
                No wonder I had to unlearn everything my brain was taught
                "Do I really belong in this game?", I pondered</p>
